 * Within an asynchronous process: the <strong>controlling component</strong>
 * creates a pipe and passes to the <strong>receiving component</strong>. The
 * <strong>receiving component</strong> detaches a {@link #stream() Stream}
 * through which values are retrieved. Once <strong>connected</strong> in this
 * fashion, the <strong>controlling component</strong> can asynchronously
 * {@link #accept(Object) supply} values to the <strong>receiving
 * component</strong>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any time after creating the pipe,
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>the <strong>controlling component</strong> <em>may</em>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>asynchronously retrieve values from an external source and
 * {@link #accept(Object) supply} them to the pipe.</li>
 * <li>{@link #pauseController(int, Duration) pause} until
 * <ul>
 * <li>some or all of the values supplied to the pipe have been
 * <strong>received</strong>.</li>
 * <li>the {@link #stream() stream} is {@link Stream#close() closed} by the
 * <strong>receiving component</strong>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>The <strong>receiving component</strong> <em>may</em>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Spliterator#trySplit() split} the stream.</li>
 * <li>{@link #pauseReceiver(int, Duration) pause} until values have been
 * {@link #accept(Object) accepted}.</li>
 * <li>block until values sufficient to complete a {@link Stream terminal
 * operation} have been {@link #accept(Object) accepted}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although {@link IuAsynchronousPipe} may be used as a simple queue on a single
 * thread, it is intended to be used concurrently on multiple threads in order
 * to distribute load related to loading and consuming large sets of homogeneous
 * values.
