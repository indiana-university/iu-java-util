//	   The contents of the JOSE Header describe the cryptographic operations
//	   applied to the JWT Claims Set.  If the JOSE Header is for a JWS, the
//	   JWT is represented as a JWS and the claims are digitally signed or
//	   MACed, with the JWT Claims Set being the JWS Payload.  If the JOSE
//	   Header is for a JWE, the JWT is represented as a JWE and the claims
//	   are encrypted, with the JWT Claims Set being the plaintext encrypted
//	   by the JWE.  A JWT may be enclosed in another JWE or JWS structure to
//	   create a Nested JWT, enabling nested signing and encryption to be
//	   performed.
//
//	   A JWT is represented as a sequence of URL-safe parts separated by
//	   period ('.') characters.  Each part contains a base64url-encoded
//	   value.  The number of parts in the JWT is dependent upon the
//	   representation of the resulting JWS using the JWS Compact
//	   Serialization or JWE using the JWE Compact Serialization.
